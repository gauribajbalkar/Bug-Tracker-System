This Java project is a simple bug tracking system that allows users to create, manage, and resolve bugs. The project consists of three main classes:

Bug: Represents a single bug with properties such as title, description, and a status indicating whether it's resolved or not.

BugTracker: Manages a list of bugs and provides methods to add bugs, resolve bugs, and display all bugs.

Main: Demonstrates how to use the Bug and BugTracker classes by adding bugs, resolving bugs, and displaying all bugs.
